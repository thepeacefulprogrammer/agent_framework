  "title": "Snake \u2014 Pygame Implementation (Prototype)",
  "overview": "A small, classic Snake game implemented in Python using pygame as a learning project and a playable prototype for local desktop environments.",
  "goals": [
    "Deliver a playable, responsive Snake game using pygame",
    "Keep the codebase small and well-documented for learning and extension",
    "Provide simple configuration (window size, speed) and an easy run/install path"
  ],
  "functional_requirements": [
    "Grid-based movement with discrete time steps",
    "Player controls the snake with keyboard (arrow keys/WASD)",
    "Food spawns at random empty grid cells; eating food increases snake length and score",
    "Collision detection ends the game when the snake hits walls or itself",
    "Display current score and high score during play",
    "Basic UI: start screen, in-game HUD, pause, game-over screen with restart option",
    "Configurable game speed (difficulty) and window size via a simple config or constants",
    "Run on Python 3.8+ with pygame (specify version) and include a requirements file"
  ],
  "non_goals": [
    "No multiplayer or networking features",
    "No advanced level editor or procedural levels",
    "No mobile/touch-specific UI (desktop-focused)",
    "No complex asset pipeline; use simple sprites or shapes"
  ],
  "user_stories": [
    "As a player, I can move the snake to collect food so I can increase my score",
    "As a player, I can see my current score and the high score",
    "As a player, I can pause and restart the game after game over",
    "As a developer, I can run the game locally with a single command and read the code to learn",
    "As a tester, I can adjust speed and grid size to validate behavior at different difficulties"
  ],
  "success_metrics": [
    "Playable without crashes for a continuous 10-minute manual play session",
    "Core game-logic unit tests for movement, food spawn, and collision pass (>=90% of critical logic covered)",
    "Startup/run documented and reproducible: pip install -r requirements.txt; python run_game.py",
    "Responsive input: no noticeable input lag at target FPS (>=30 FPS on typical dev machine)"
  ],
  "open_questions": [
    "Preferred default window/grid size and pixel art vs. simple geometric shapes?",
    "Target pygame version (recommend latest stable for Python 3.8+)?",
    "Any required sound assets or can simple beeps suffice (or optional)?",
    "Should high score persist across sessions (file-based) or be in-memory only?",
    "Packaging expectations: source-only, a wheel, or a standalone executable?"
