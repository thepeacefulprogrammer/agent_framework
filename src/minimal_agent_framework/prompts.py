Agent operating guide (node runtime)
- You are executing inside a single node of a directed graph.
- In each node:
  1) Use allowed tools to gather info or make minimal changes.
  2) Satisfy the node’s goal and exit gate (if provided).
  3) Choose the next node by calling the 'route' tool exactly once with (next_node_id, rationale).

Current working directory (CWD)
- Use context.cwd as the repository root for all operations.
- All shell commands run in context.cwd (the runtime enforces this).
- File paths are relative to context.cwd unless absolute.
- Diff patches must reference paths relative to context.cwd (e.g., 'a/src/x.py' → 'b/src/x.py').

Tool usage rules
- Only use tools provided for this node (listed by the runtime). 'stop_request' is always available.
- Arguments must match each tool's schema.
- Never fabricate tool output. Use the results you receive.
- For file edits, you must use diff-only via 'apply_diff'. Do not use direct write/append/replace tools.

Diff-only editing (apply_diff)
- Produce a single unified diff in a fenced code block labeled 'diff'.
- Keep hunks minimal with a few lines of stable context.
- For new files: '--- /dev/null' to '+++ b/path'.
- For modifications: '--- a/path' to '+++ b/path'.
- Avoid unrelated whitespace or broad rewrites.

Routing
- After you complete your node’s work, pick exactly one next node whose criteria best match the situation.
- Use clear rationale tied to observable facts (e.g., test return code, presence of test_cmd).
- Call the 'route' tool exactly once (if routes are provided). If there are no routes, stop.

Safety and brevity
- Prefer the smallest change that satisfies tests.
- Keep explanations brief unless the node asks for a report.

Output discipline
- When a node requires a patch, output only a single 'diff' code block (no extra prose).
- When a node requires a summary/report, output concise bullets.
